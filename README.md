# React Admin Panel Project web-app frontend development
## Project Overview 🚀
This project is a React-based Admin Panel that allows users to manage a list of members. The primary features include filtering, editing, and deleting members with a user-friendly interface. The application also implements pagination and provides a smooth user experience. This project was part of the application process for the role of Frontend Internship (web-app frontend development) at HireQuotient.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI: A popular React UI framework for creating responsive and visually appealing components.
React Toastify: A toast notification library for React applications.

## Project Requirements 📋
### 1. Column Titles Styling 📊
Column titles should stand out from the entries. This is achieved by using the Material-UI Box component with bold styling.

### 2. Search Bar Functionality 🔍
The application includes a search bar that can filter entries based on any property. Users can type in the search box and click the "Search" button or press "Enter" to trigger the search.

### 3. Edit and Delete Rows 🖊️ 🗑️
Users can edit or delete rows in place. There is no expectation of persistence, and these actions are intended to only happen in memory.

### 4. Pagination Implementation 📄
Pagination is implemented, with each page containing 10 rows. Buttons at the bottom allow users to jump to any page, including special buttons for the first page, previous page, next page, and last page. Pagination updates based on search/filtering.

### 5. Row Selection and Deletion 🧑‍💻
Users can select one or more rows. A selected row is highlighted with a grayish background color. Multiple selected rows can be deleted at once using the 'Delete Selected' button at the top right bin icon.

### 6. Shortcut Checkbox ⭕
A checkbox on the top left serves as a shortcut to select or deselect all displayed rows. This applies only to the ten rows displayed on the current page, not all rows.

### 7. Search Box Placeholder 📝
The search box placeholder text starts with "Search."

### 8. Search Trigger 🕵️‍♂️
The search icon/button has a class name as "search-icon" and triggers the search on "Enter" key press.

### 9. Action Element Styling ⚙️
Action elements, such as edit, delete, and save, are implemented as buttons with specific class names.

### 10. Navigation Elements 📲
Navigation elements, including first-page, previous-page, next-page, and last-page buttons, are implemented as div/button components with appropriate class names. Page numbers are displayed accordingly.

### 11. Inline Editing 📝
Clicking the edit action in a row makes it editable in the row itself.

### 12. Libraries Used 📚
React: The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI: A React UI framework for creating visually appealing components.
React Toastify: A toast notification library for providing user feedback.
